# What is System Design? - Study Notes

## Definition

System design is a **set of requirements** that guides us to:

1. **Decide architecture** - Overall system structure
2. **Decide components** - Individual parts of the system
3. **Decide modules** - Functional units

All working together to define **how they interact with each other**

**System Design ≈ Product Development** → Both aim **to solve the problem**

## Why is System Design So Popular?

### Universal Relevance
- **Every single "tech" product is a "system"** that has been "designed"
- Companies are building products and **need you all to design it**
- It's not just a skill - it's a fundamental requirement for tech roles

---

## Why Understanding System Design is Important?

### This is Real Work
- **This is what people do at work** - not theoretical exercise
- **Everything is practical** - directly applicable knowledge
- **You can see it from Day 1 of joining the company** - immediate relevance

### Career Growth
- **Once you grow in your career, you will spend 80% of time doing this**
- System design becomes your primary responsibility as you advance

## Side Effects of System Design

### Positive Impacts

#### Makes Everything Interesting
- Opposite: Without it, everything becomes uninteresting
- **You solve real problems, not something made up**

#### Structured Thinking
- **Break down problem statements** into manageable parts
- **Re-wires your brain to think in a structured way**
  - Considering all possible cases
  - Evaluating edge scenarios
  - To deliver a great user experience!

## What Will We Do When We Design a System?

### Our Approach

1. **Break down problem statement into solvable sub-problems**
   - Decompose complex requirements into manageable chunks

2. **Decide on key components and responsibilities**
   - Identify what each part of the system should do

3. **Decide on boundaries of each component**
   - Define clear interfaces and separation of concerns

4. **Touch upon key challenges in scaling it**
   - Consider growth, performance, and capacity planning

5. **Make own architecture fault-tolerant and available**
   - Design for reliability and high availability

## Key Takeaway

System design is not just a skill to learn for interviews - it's **the core of what software engineers do every day**. It transforms how you think about problems, making you consider all angles to build systems that truly work at scale.
