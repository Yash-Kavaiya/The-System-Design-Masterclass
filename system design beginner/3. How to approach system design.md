# Detailed Notes: How to Approach System Design

## **Core Philosophy**

System design is **extremely practical** and requires a **structured approach** to tackle complex situations effectively. The key principle is to **take baby steps** - break down the problem systematically rather than trying to solve everything at once.

---

## **Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement**

**Critical Foundation:**
- Before writing any code or creating any diagrams, you must have a **thorough understanding** of the problem at hand
- Without this understanding, you will **easily digress** and lose focus
- Take time to clarify requirements, constraints, and expectations
- Ask clarifying questions about:
  - Scale (number of users, requests per second)
  - Features required vs. nice-to-have
  - Performance requirements
  - Budget/infrastructure constraints

---

## **Step 2: Break It Down Into Components (Essential)**

**Component Identification:**

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT create components just for the sake of it** when starting
- ‚úÖ **Only create components that you KNOW are essential/must-have**
- Start minimal, then expand as needed

**Example: Design Facebook**

Essential components/features would include:
1. **Auth** (Authentication/Authorization)
2. **Notification** (User notifications)
3. **Feed** (News feed generation)
4. **Gamification** (Likes, reactions, engagement)

**Initial Architecture:**
```
User ‚Üí Gateway (GW) ‚Üí {
    - Auth Service
    - Notification Service  
    - Feed Service
}
```

---

## **Step 3: Dissect Each Component (If Required)**

Once you have high-level components, break them down further into **sub-components**.

**Example: Feed Component Breakdown**

The Feed component might have:
- **Generator** - Creates/generates feed content
- **Aggregator** - Collects and sorts content from various sources
- **Webserver** - Handles HTTP requests and responses

**Architecture:**
```
User ‚Üî Webserver ‚Üî Database
              ‚Üï
        Feed Component:
        - Generator ‚Üî Database
        - Aggregator ‚Üî Database
```

---

## **Step 4: Analyze Each Sub-Component (Critical Deep Dive)**

For **each sub-component**, systematically look into these **4 key factors**:

### **1. Database and Caching**
- What data needs to be stored?
- SQL vs. NoSQL choice?
- What caching strategy? (Redis, Memcached)
- Cache invalidation strategy?
- Data consistency requirements?

### **2. Scaling & Fault Tolerance**
- How will this scale horizontally/vertically?
- Load balancing strategy?
- Redundancy and replication?
- What happens if this component fails?
- Circuit breaker patterns?

### **3. Async Processing (Delegation)**
- What tasks can be done asynchronously?
- Message queues? (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Background job processors?
- Event-driven architecture considerations?

### **4. Communication**
- How do components communicate?
- REST APIs? gRPC? GraphQL?
- Synchronous vs. Asynchronous communication?
- API contracts and versioning?

**‚ö†Ô∏è REPEAT this analysis for EACH sub-component, one by one**

## **Step 5: Handle Dependencies Between Services**

**Complex Service Interactions:**

**Example: Feed Generation with Multiple Services**

```
Post Service ‚îÄ‚îê
              ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Merger ‚Üê‚îÄ Follow Service
Recommendation Service ‚îÄ‚îò      ‚Üì
                         Feed Database
                              ‚Üï
User ‚Üî Web Server ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                              
                    Feed Generator
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Dependency on other services** - How do services depend on each other?
- Services like Post Service and Recommendation Service feed into a **Merger**
- The Merger combines data from multiple sources
- Follow Service provides social graph data
- Everything flows into the Feed Database
- Web Server retrieves from database to serve users

---

## **Step 6: Add More Sub-Components If Needed (Iterative)**

As you refine your design, you may need to add more components. For each new component:

### **Process:**
1. **Understand the scope** 
   - Why is this component needed?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What are its boundaries?

2. **Decide how other components will talk to this new one**
   - What APIs does it expose?
   - What APIs does it consume?
   - Communication patterns?

3. **Decide on the 4 factors** (from Step 4)
   - Database and Caching
   - Scaling & Fault Tolerance  
   - Async Processing
   - Communication

4. **Repeat** - Apply this process recursively for any new additions

## **Summary: The Structured Approach**

```
1. Understand Problem Statement
   ‚Üì
2. Break Into High-Level Components
   ‚Üì
3. Dissect Each Component Into Sub-Components
   ‚Üì
4. Analyze Each Sub-Component:
   - Database/Caching
   - Scaling/Fault Tolerance
   - Async Processing
   - Communication
   ‚Üì
5. Handle Service Dependencies
   ‚Üì
6. Add More Components (Repeat from Step 3)
```

## **Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **Start simple** - Only essential components initially  
‚úÖ **Be methodical** - Follow the structured approach systematically  
‚úÖ **Think deeply** - Consider all 4 factors for every sub-component  
‚úÖ **Iterate** - Add complexity gradually as needed  
‚úÖ **Stay practical** - System design is about real-world tradeoffs  
‚úÖ **Don't over-engineer** - Avoid creating components "for the sake of it"  

**Remember:** Take baby steps, no matter what! üöÄ
